Definitly for Acorn 0.4:

  Implement loading the same map as the client.

  Sort out collision detection wrt moving alongside an object in close
  proximity, and add CD for two moving objects. Basically we need sliding.
  along an object. This can be done by zeroing the velocity along
  the axis perpendicular to the collision. Obviously we need to add
  a mechanism for establishing which axis is perpendicular to the collision.
  This now works, but the direction the moving entity is facing needs to be
  modified.

  Sort out collision prediction between two moving entities. Current problem
  is that it is not possible to tell when movement started, and thus get
  correct starting position for the movement.

  Use drunkness.

  Fully implement stackable objects.
  Use combine operation to deal with making more than one object into one.

Provisional for Acorn 0.4:

  Implement accelerated Atlas Objects API. MAYBE:
    POSTPONED FROM 0.3
    POSTPONED FROM 0.4

Required for werewolf:

  Implement calendric time using WorldTime and DateTime classes, so nighttime
  and moons are properlly handled.

  Implement sleeping.

Possible ideas:

  Add fully featured database persistance.

  Persistance system is naive right now. It does not take account of that
  fact that characters need minds, and it stores the world object.

  Get system working as an AI client to another server. This would also
  be a good time to get cyphesis working as a mindless server, without
  any AI code.

  Need to get rid of leaking default ScriptObject.
