Must be sorted out immediatly after Acorn 0.3:

  Sort out floating point world_info::time. Currently time is fetched
  using time(2). Should use gettimeofday(2) I think.

  Implement get_object from Python, so that entities can look things up by id.
  I am currently trying to avoid having to do this, so far successfully.

  Modify Thing::operator[] so that it handles attributes that are static.
  Make it virtual, etc. Then clean up get/setattr in Python/C API code.

  Think of a way to correctly handle the fact that world is top level container.
  Should it list itself as loc, or not?

Definitly for Acorn 0.4:

  Implement accelerated Atlas Objects API.

  Implement ranges.

  Implement collison detection.

  Implement loading the same map as the client.
