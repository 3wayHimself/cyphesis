.SH NAME
cycmd \- cycmd game server process
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBcycmd\fR [ \fB--section:option=value\fR\fI ...\fR ] [ \fBcommand [ server ]\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBcycmd\fR program provides a commandline interface to a
cyphesis server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Configuration options are divided up into named sections, which need to
be specified when modifying or overriding the options. In a config file
the name of a section is specified in square brackets at the beginning
of the section. On the command line the section is given at the
beginning of the option specification, as shown in the synopsis above.
.SS "CLIENT OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options used by \fBcycmd\fR are present in the
client section of the config file, and overriden by specifying the client
section name on the command line.
.TP
\fBserverhost=hostname \fR
Hostname of the server to connect to.

This setting provides the hostname of the system where cyphesis is running
that \fBcycmd\fR should try and connect to.
.SS "SERVER OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are present in the cyphesis section of the config
file, and overriden by specifying the cyphesis section name on the
command line. These options apply to the server, but are also required
by the client to ensure that the client can connect.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The first example shows getting the current server status and checking
the lobby to see if any users are logged in.

.nf
cyphesis> stat
Info(
     builddate:  11:32:45, Sep 27 2004
     clients:  1
     name:  calcitration.ecs.soton.ac.uk
     objtype:  obj
     parents:  [  server ]
     ruleset:  mason
     server:  cyphesis
     uptime:  1728.2
     version:  0.3.2
)
cyphesis> look
Sight(
      id: lobby
      name: lobby
      objtype: obj
      parents: [  room ]
      people: [  1 ]
      rooms: [  ]
)
cyphesis> 
  
.fi
.PP
The first entity returned shows various information about the server,
including when it was built, the number of connected client, the
current ruleset, and the server uptime. The second entity representing
the lobby shows that only one user is current logged in, and no chat
rooms have been created.
.PP
The second example shows how to install a new type.

.nf
cyphesis> get thing

     velocity:  [  0 0 0 ]
)
cyphesis> install box thing
cyphesis> 
  
.fi
.PP
The third example shows server monitoring being enable, followed by information
of a series of in-game operations. The flow of messages in while monitoring the
server can be large. In order to supress the flow, the
\fBunmonitor\fR command must be used.

.nf
cyphesis> monitor 
cyphesis> 
tick(from="900006",to="900006")
tick(from="900007",to="900007")
cyphesis> 
tick(from="900008",to="900008")
cyphesis> 
tick(from="899982",to="899982")
cyphesis>

cyphesis>

cyphesis>
