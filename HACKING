Cyphesis-C++ development is currently being done on a semi-closed basis.
I do not currently consider that the code is ready for contributions
as the design has not quite stabilised. Anyone is encourage however to
contribute scripts to implement new game features. If your game features
require modification of the C++ core, please contact me on irc, or using
the email address given in the AUTHORS file.

The following guidelines should be observer when coding cyphesis-C++.

TEMPLATES

Use of templates is not encouraged.

REFERENCES

References should be used instead of pointers whereever it is possible.
If necessary the design of the code should reflect this preference.
If a pointer is to be used which will be initialised to a value, will
never change and can never be NULL, then that pointer should be a reference.

RETURN VALUES

Integer return values should not be used explicitly when only success or
failure is being returned. Use bool in these cases.
