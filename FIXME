	* server/ScriptFactory.cpp:77 This is unsafe code to be in a
	  constructor. Move it somewhere else. This class is probably
	  doing something similar to the issue in FIXME #3. Does
	  a task factory need to load modules, and get classes, just
	  like a script factory? Almost certainly.

#3  2006-12-24  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* server/TaskFactory.h:59 Work out what was intended by getClass()
	  and addScript() methods, currently unimplemented.

#2  2006-07-01  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* server/CorePropertyManager.cpp:41 Add code to delete all the
	  factories at shutdown. FIXED

#1  2006-06-30  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* server/EntityFactory.cpp:74 Commented out code for three hard coded
	  entity classes should be removed once Line and Area are removed
	  from the code.
