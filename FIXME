#12  2007-09-22  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org> FIXED

	* rulesets/Pedestrian.cpp: Why is the new_location parameter of
	  generateMove not const? It does not seem to be modified.

#11  2007-09-22  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* rulesets/Pedestrian.cpp: Move this calculation inside the if check
	  and test well.

#10  2007-01-05  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org> FIXED

	* rulesets/OutfitProperty.cpp: Signals used to trigger removing
	  clothing when it is dropped need to be disconnected. Not sure how
	  without a whole bunch of annoying sigc++ connections in a map.

#9  2007-01-05  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org> FIXED

	* rulesets/OutfitProperty.cpp:171 Signals connected to the
	  property still seem to call the property methods after the
	  entity owning the property has been deleted.

#8  2007-01-03  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* rulesets/Character.cpp:503 Temp hack in of outfit property.
	  which should really be handled by the property manager in future.

#7  2006-12-30  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* Thing::MoveOp Thing::UpdateOp: Try and work it so that the
	  velocity flag can be used as the only necessary check if something
	  is moving. Ie make sure if the velocity is zero, it is cleared.

#6  2006-12-26  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org> FIXED

	* rulesets/Character.h Remove the hard m_sex property from character

#5  2006-12-26  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org> FIXED

	* rulesets/BaseMind.h:42 Remove m_world, and the m_world in Entity, as
	  we now use the singleton accessor in BaseWorld for that

#4  2006-12-24  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* server/ScriptFactory.cpp:77 This is unsafe code to be in a
	  constructor. Move it somewhere else. This class is probably
	  doing something similar to the issue in FIXME #3. Does
	  a task factory need to load modules, and get classes, just
	  like a script factory? Almost certainly.

#3  2006-12-24  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* server/TaskFactory.h:59 Work out what was intended by getClass()
	  and addScript() methods, currently unimplemented. The also exist
	  unimplemented in ArithmeticFactory. Here we have 3 types of
	  factory all doing basically the same thing, with the same
	  members and all. Much as we abore MI, it may be the right
	  thing to do.

#2  2006-07-01  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org> FIXED

	* server/CorePropertyManager.cpp:41 Add code to delete all the
	  factories at shutdown.

#1  2006-06-30  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org> FIXED

	* server/EntityFactory.cpp:74 Commented out code for three hard coded
	  entity classes should be removed once Line and Area are removed
	  from the code.
