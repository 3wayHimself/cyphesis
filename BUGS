Plant C++ base class is totally screwed.

Moving in and out of structures is very buggy. Some objects which are not
structures seem to be getting non-solid bounding boxes when they
are not structures. It seems that entities inside a structure all end
up with being treated as if their bounding boxes were not solid.

I suspect there may be something wrong with the _num_coerce functions
in python interface code. Some of them do not increment references before
returning.
