Some NPCs do not seem able to determine correctly the attributes of
entities. This is a particular problem if the entity was created before the
NPC. Something about the whole lookid thing is still not working. It seems
that some attributes make it, and some don't. name in particular seems to
not work.

Pigs seem to get stuck when they eat an Acorn, probably because they do not
see it get deleted.

Plant C++ base class is totally screwed.

Moving in and out of structures is very buggy. Some objects which are not
structures seem to be getting non-solid bounding boxes when they
are not structures. It seems that entities inside a structure all end
up with being treated as if their bounding boxes were not solid.

I suspect there may be something wrong with the _num_coerce functions
in python interface code. Some of them do not increment references before
returning.
