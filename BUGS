Destination based movement: Change in direction is wrong when specifying
a new destination for a walking character. Still have problem if destination
is specified inside a box. Jump to it after a period of time, whereas
we should stay outside.

Plant C++ base class is totally screwed.

If a character dies, it does not get removed from its accounts dictionary,
so its bad mkay.

Are touches getting broadcast?

BUG When a character gets deleted that an account is not currently in
direct control of, but that account owns, and has a pointer to it in
its connection object (ie currently connected account), it does not get
removed from that connection object. This is a more general problem,
in that we are storing pointers to entities in several places. And not
clearing them when they no longer exist. Might be able to fix with SigC
signals, which were in the longterm anyway. Made BaseEntity inherit, so
we can use throughout.
