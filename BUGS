cycmd does not handle traffic asynchronously.

If a character sets its velocity to 0 when its position is outside its
parents bbox, then the collision code does not detect that it is outside.

Destination based movement: Change in direction is wrong when specifying
a new destination for a walking character. Still have problem if destination
is specified inside a box. Jump to it after a period of time, whereas
we should stay outside.

Plant C++ base class is totally screwed.

If a character dies, it does not get removed from its accounts dictionary,
so its bad mkay.

Are touches getting broadcast?
