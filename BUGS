Some NPCs do not seem able to determine correctly the attributes of
entities. This is a particular problem if the entity was created before the
NPC. Something about the whole lookid thing is still not working. It seems
that some attributes make it, and some don't. name in particular seems to
not work.

  Think of a way to correctly handle the fact that world is top level container.
  Should it list itself as loc, or not?
