Welcome to cyphesis, at the time of writing the only fully armed and
operational WorldForge server. Cyphesis is being developed as a small
scale or personal server for WorldForge games, and is currently being used
to develop bleeding edge techniques and technologies for the WorldForge
project. Code from cyphesis will also be used to control NPCs in future
servers such as STAGE using AI techniques.

Installation:

cyphesis is built using autoconf. Please see the file INSTALL for details.
It requires Python, Berkeley db3 which are include with most Linux
distributions, and Atlas-C++, varconf and skstream which are provided
by the WorldForge project. GNU readline is required by some of the
included tools.

Copyright:

The server code in C++ is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
See the file COPYING for details. The script files included with this
distribution are also distributed under the GNU General Public License.
Note that this copyright does not cover user scripts that use server
services but do not use code from the scripts provided. Using such
scripts is considered ordinary use of the server, and does not fall under
the heading of derived work.

Usage and configuration:

The main server binary is called cyphesis. Its command line arguments
and configuration are managed by varconf, which means options are
set in config files and on the command line. The main configuration
file is called cyphesis.vconf, and server settings are stored in the
[cyphesis] section. Settings in this config file can be overriden in on
the command line, and once overriden they will be stored permanently in
.cyphesis.vconf in the users home directory. In order to drop back to
the default settings, remove this file.

As an example, the ruleset to be used is set in cyphesis.vconf as follows:

ruleset="acorn"

This setting can be overriden by invoking cyphesis with the following
option:

--cyphesis:ruleset=acorn

For more details of vconf usage see the Varconf documentation. For full
details on configuring cyphesis, see the configuration docementation.

The ruleset specified indicates the entity types available, and the set
of scripts that will be used for these entities, and the initialisation
script used to populate the server.

The server is populated using the client program, cyclient.

The default ruleset for this version is mason, but the acorn ruleset is
provided, including the files required to be loaded into the world database.
To switch to the acorn ruleset, follow the instructions above, after
loading the agrilan*.xml files into the world database using the cydload
command.
