Welcome to cyphesis, at the time of writing the only fully armed and
operational WorldForge server. Cyphesis is being developed as a small
scale or personal server for WorldForge games, and is currently being used
to develop bleeding edge techniques and technologies for the WorldForge
project. Code from cyphesis will also be used to control NPCs in future
servers such as STAGE using AI techniques.

Installation:

cyphesis is built using autoconf. Please see the file INSTALL for details.
It requires Python and PostgreSQL which are include with most Linux
distributions, and Atlas-C++, varconf and skstream2 which are provided
by the WorldForge project. PostgreSQL must have been built with the C++
libraries enabled. If you are building PostgreSQL from source, please check
the PostgreSQL documentation for information on how to enable building the
C++ libraries. GNU readline is required by some of the included tools.

Under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, you are

core, I believe in your freedom to do what you want with the software, and I
do not believe I have any right to force you to publish any changes if
you do not wish to redistribute the modified program. There has been some
discusion within the Free Software movement about this issue, which some
see as a hole in the GPL, and it is possible that a future version of the
GNU General Public License will forbid using a modified version of a GPL
licensed program to run a service unless the changes to the source code
are made available. The licensing of this program permits redistribution
under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or at the
licensees option, a later version, so it is possible that a version of
this program may be released that is under the terms of a license which
requires the source code changes to be published for a modified version
being used to run an online service. As the current author and owner of
the source code to this program, I have never intended that this restriction
be placed on the software, and do not support its enforcement. The scripts
provided with this software should be considered a separate work, as they
were not written by me. Nothing in this paragraph should be considered to
be a legal statement of any kind. It is simply a clarification of my
opinion on some of the terms of the GNU General Public License. If anything
in the above paragraph is unclear, please feel free to contact me to discuss
it.

Usage and configuration:

The main server binary is called cyphesis. Its command line arguments
and configuration are managed by varconf, which means options are
set in config files and on the command line. The main configuration
file is called cyphesis.vconf, and server settings are stored in the
[cyphesis] section. Settings in this config file can be overriden in on
the command line, and once overriden they will be stored permanently in
.cyphesis.vconf in the users home directory. In order to drop back to
the default settings, remove this file.

As an example, the ruleset to be used is set in cyphesis.vconf as follows:

ruleset="acorn"

This setting can be overriden by invoking cyphesis with the following
option:

--cyphesis:ruleset=acorn

For more details of vconf usage see the Varconf documentation. For full
details on configuring cyphesis, see the configuration docementation.

The ruleset specified indicates the entity types available, and the set
of scripts that will be used for these entities, and the initialisation
script used to populate the server.

The server is populated using the client program, cyclient.

The default ruleset for this version is mason, but the acorn ruleset is
provided, including the files required to be loaded into the world database.
To switch to the acorn ruleset, follow the instructions above, after
loading the agrilan*.xml files into the world database using the cydload
command.

Before you start the server for the first time, you will need to load some
data into the server. You will first have to load ruleset data, and
then map data into the database. If this is the first time you have run
cyphesis since it was switched to use PostgreSQL, you will need to set
it up so cyphesis has access. In order to use databases, cyphesis needs
to know the name of an account it can use, and the name of a database
where it can create its tables. By default it uses the name cyphesis
for both, and if possible you should create a user called cyphesis
and a database with the same name belonging to this user. For information
on how to do this, please see the PostgreSQL documentation provided
with the version you have installed.

Once cyphesis has access, run cypasswd with no arguments to set the
admin password to something unique.

A ruleset will need to be loaded into the database before you can do anything
useful with the server.  Each ruleset optionally depends on another ruleset,
so in addition to the ruleset you are using you will need to load the
rulesets on which it depends. A ruleset is distributed with cyphesis
as an xml. The default is mason.xml, which depends on acorn.xml, which in
turn depends on basic.xml. These three rulesets can be loaded into the
database using the cyloadrules command, with no arguments. This
automatically loads the rulesets in order into the database, first
ensuring that the rules table is empty.

cyloadrules can also be used to load individual rulesets into the database
as follows:

cyloadrules basic.xml
cyloadrules acorn.xml
cyloadrules mason.xml

You will only need to do this if you are developing new rulesets, or
customising existing ones.

You should now load map data into the server using cydbload. The map for early
mason release is the same as the acorn map, and is stored in agrilan*.xml:

cydbload agrilan.xml
cydbload agrilan_a1.xml
cydbload agrilan_a2.xml
cydbload agrilan_a3.xml
cydbload agrilan_a4.xml

Once these tasks are done, it is safe to run cyphesis. You will not need to
do them again. The database store is persistant. If new a ruleset
or map is provided, it will be necessary to clear the database tables
before loading them with new data.

Once cyphesis is running, it will contain all the entities in the map,
but there will be few or no active entities in the world. In order to set
up a game, you need to run a client to set up the rest. The client
will use a script included in the current ruleset to define what the
world should contain. This script is kept together with the entity and
AI scripts required for the ruleset in a directory under the rulesets
directory. For example, the mason script is found in
rulesets/mason/define_world.py. In order to populate the world,
simply run cyclient once the server is running. You will need to do
this each time cyphesis is started.
