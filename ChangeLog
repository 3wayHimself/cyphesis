2000-11-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added code for standard Get/Set methods for operations.
	  Eventually this functionality will be moved into getattr
	  and setattr methods.

	* Added code for a Thing object which wrappers a C++ Thing * pointer.

2000-11-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Cleaned up problems with mode in move operations, and dealt
	  with stopping when velocity is set to zero.

2000-11-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed silly typo in movement code which meant that velocity was
	  not being used to calculate direction when only velocity is
	  specified.

2000-11-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added more Python/C API code. Basic framework now exists for
	  creating and manipulating Operations in the python code.

2000-11-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed setting location of newly created objects

	* Fixed setting weight as float on default Thing.

	* Added more support for mode and face in movement code.

	* Cleaned up the debugging output code.

	* Fixed looking, and added support for contains attribute

2000-11-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added more refno capabilities

	* Fixed some operation instantiation bugs

	* Added full support for creator entity. Admin client can now populate
	  the world with items and NPCs.

2000-11-09  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Removed two conflicting "WorldRouter * world" members from
	  class hierarchy.

	* Added setting of refno to operations, so client can tell
	  what they apply to.

	* Sorted out initialisation of python path.

	* Added loading of admin account, allowing admin client to communicate.

	* Made sure all attributes of created objects are set, so that
	  character gender works.

	* Added face attribute to Thing, to indicate what direction it faces!

	* Modified error operation so it complies with traditional format

2000-11-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added enough python interface to load a simple module, get the
	  class from it, instantiate that class, and call operation methods
	  from it. Still to be implented is the Atlas-C++ API for embedded
	  python.

2000-11-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed movement code so that id of object to be moved is correctly
	  present. uclient now sees movement. Woohoo!

2000-11-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixed. uclient movement now works within the server,
	  but uclient does not like the responses it gets.

	* Fixed a bug which caused a segfault when movement stops.

2000-11-05  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixes, including lots of clearer debugging output.
	  Still does not seem to correctly handle moves which don't 
	  specify direction.

2000-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixes. I now get almost expected behavoir

	* Switched over to new Atlas location spec now that this is supported
	  by uclient.

2000-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Improved debugging output in movement code, and fixed some critical
	  bugs which meant that movement was not working correctly.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Modified legacy location code so it is now activated by a single
	  #define

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added temporary support for old Atlas style location object
	  in entity to move operations. This allows uclient to work for
	  now until it moves over to the latest Atlas spec.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed some attributes of in-game object

	* Added temporary support for old style Atlas location so we still
	  work with uclient.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed it so that server does not exit if client negotiation fails.

	* Cleaned up detection of disconnected client

	* Re-wrote thing factory so it is now a static object instance rather
	  that a static method, and added the beginnings of support for
	  python "Thing" classes.

2000-10-31  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Modified stream code to get rid of seeking-on socket problem

2000-10-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added handling of client disconnection

2000-10-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed movement code which now works.

	* Fixed set operation, and added attributes map to Thing.

	* Started adding Python interface code.

        * Starting changelog from initial attempt to port cyphesis into C++.
