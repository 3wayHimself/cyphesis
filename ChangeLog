	  the build. Used to track details of the time. Added support for
	  checking time descriptions such as "midday", "summer" against

	  so that the arrow is removed from inventory as it is fired.

	* client/define_world.py: Added archer, arrow and deer to test
	  shooting code.

	* server/server.cpp: Made CommClient more robust in the event
	  if immediate disconnection by initialising pointers to NULL;

	  rulesets/Character.cpp, rulesets/Entity.h, rulesets/Entity.cpp,
	  rulesets/Python_API.cpp: Added handling of operation types not
	  directly supported by C++ classes in the scripting engine. In
	  order for these to be used they must be created in a script, and
	  received in a script.

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Avoid using RootOperation pointers unless
	  that is really what we mean.

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Added code to delete operations from
	  internal mind when external mind is active.

	  that there is no confusion between ref for coordinates
	  and parent in the Atlas hierarchy.

	* rulesets/Thing.cpp: Added code to move operation to check
	  what entities come into and out of range when entity moves.

	  be accessed, and certain move operations caused an abort.

	* Removed attributes from python object which don't have attributes.

	* Added Py*_Check() macros, and used them for easier code reading.

	* Added snow attribute to weather.

	* Heavy use of inlining to improve code performance.

	* Added global exception handler to catch exceptions while processing
	  operations.

2000-12-11  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	  deal with stuttering NPC movement.

2000-12-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Major attack on the more fiddly memory leaks. The only noticable
	  leak now is copied Location objects in the python interface code.

	* Added hook into the time code so the server can be set to exit
	  after a given number of seconds. This is required for LeakTracer
	  to generate its report.

2000-12-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed so that we are no longer sending broadcast look ops, which
	  clag the server up and are not correct behavoir.

	* Minor fixes/python tweaks.

	* Slight change to ordering of ops in the queue, so more recently
	  created ops with the same time stamp come of the queue after
	  older ops.

	* Implemented contains attribute so newly created objects are added
	  to their parents contains list, and when objects are move, they are
	  transfered from old parents to new parents contains list.

2000-12-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added handling for removing connections.

	* Added handling for initialisation of location.parent using me
	  in mind code.

	* Added is_object_delete() functionality to python interface to world
	  object.

	* Added handling for converting Tuple into Message::Object, and then
	  ensured that non-basic python types don't get stored as attributes
	  of a Message::Object.

2000-12-06  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixes to worlds object list so it now contains world.

	* More python code tweaks to work with modifications to interface.

	  dealloc() function as it was causing segfaults. There is a problem
	  somewhere with ownership not being cleared, but I can't find it.

	* Implemented conversion of Python Operation and Oplist objects
	  to Message::Object.

	* Fixed MemMap so that attributes of Things are accuratly updated.

	* Fixed it so that look ops from mind are broadcast rather than sent
	  to world. This may have to be reverted.

	* Tweaked autoconf to make it cleaner and work better. Still needs
	  alot of work.

2000-12-05  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added new common namespace to prevent collision with math function
	  log.

	* Added in lots of deletes to sort memory leaks.

	* More python tweaks.

	* Implemented status attributes of thing.

	* Re-wrote some code which needlessly creates objects in the
	  free store.

2000-12-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Started working on sorting out memory leaks.

	* Implemented python function to deal with not being able to check
	  type of python objects implemented in C.

	* Added method to thing for extracting location data from a
	  Message::Object

	* More work on python references to improve leakage.

	* Added flag so that python Operation object can own
	  the operation they point to, and thus delete it in dealloc().

	* Implemented find_by_location() and find_by_type() as required in
	  MemMap, and corresponding python interface.

	* Put in temporary work around to deal with the fact that a mind
	  does not know its name. Currently the mind is not able to
	  discover any of its bodies attributes, and I am not sure how
	  to solve this.

	* Fixed Location and Vector3D so they use operator bool() to detect
	  whether they are set.

	* Fixed bugs in getting parent from Location in python which caused
	  segfaults.

	* Imported all the basic ruleset entity python scripts.

	* Added more required functionality to base python Thing class
	  so that operation manipulations can now work.

	* Implemented getting of object name to python/C API, and added
	  methods for differentiating between op and object.

	* Implemented on-the-fly de-coding of operations, from operation
	  arguuments in python/C API. This will be obsolete once Atlas-C++
	  does full decode later.

	* Implemented get and setattr for Message Object from
	  python. Attributes are stored both in Object, and in supplementary
	  python dictionary for non Atlas compatable attributes.

	* Implemented copy() method for Python/C Location class.

2000-11-29  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	  Can fill in functionality as required.

	* Put debugging back in cos I still need it.

2000-11-26  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added in Python interface code to deal with manipulation of operation
	  time.

	* Made basic_tick a float, because it should be.

	* Imported all the rulesets python code from python cyphesis.

2000-11-26  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed and changes to code so that operations created in python
	  mind code are delivered as required.

2000-11-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Disabled some of the excessive debugging.

	* Implemented getting and setting of to and from in operations
	  using map to lookup what the mind knows about the entities
	  in question. This involved adding an extra field to the
	  RootOperationObject structure to store to and from entities.

	* Sorted out base_init() python member so __init__() of all
	  classes in inheritance tree are called.

	* Started work on set_kw() replacement.

	* Added python module finding mechanism which is required to deal
	  with rulesets correctly. I am not convinced this works.

2000-11-23  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added oplist python interface, and implemented returning of
	  operations from python code.

2000-11-22  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added new MovementInfo method which creates a movement op to
	  change the rotation of a character when no other update is needed.

2000-11-22  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Filled out Location python interface so it is now fully functional.

	* Inlined Vector3D class for performance.

2000-11-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Bug fix that meant that updates to MemMap object caused segfault.

2000-11-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Filled out the python common.const module with all its values.

	* Added code required to create an operation from with python.

	* Modified the Thing python interface so that python objects
	  that Atlas doesn't want to know about are stored in a normal
	  attributes list.

2000-11-20  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added some more python interface classes. There is now enough code
	  here to start importing real mind code from cyphesis-py.

2000-11-19  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Two small bug fixes. One stops a crash when the client tries
	  to move an object which does not exist, the other removes an
	  unnecessary pointer check which stopped the admin client from
	  working.

2000-11-19  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Filled in BaseMind functionality so it now keeps memory map up		  to date. Added necessary features to Python/C++ interface
	  for sight operations to be passed onto python code after processing
	  in C++. Added new type of op switch to deal with operations
	  in the argument of a sight/sound operation.

	* Added features to Opeation python interface for args to be
	  accessed as if operation is a sequence object.

	* Implemented python API for C++ memory map class.

	* Added utility function which uses code borrowed from Atlas-C++
	  to convert a Message::Object into something from the Objects
	  code.

2000-11-18  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Moved some of BaseMind functionality in a python class and
	  added the necessary interface code.

	* Initial port of MemMap class from python to C++, together with
	  python interface. Hopefully maintenance of MemMap can be kept
	  in C++ for speed if possible.

2000-11-16  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Sorted out error handling from python code, and no-longer treat
	  no method as an error.

	* Got python interface code to the point that python classes can now
	  access the C++ attributes of a Thing.

	* Split the python interface code into separate files depending
	  on the type of C++ class the code relates to.

2000-11-16  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added code for standard Get/Set methods for operations.
	  Eventually this functionality will be moved into getattr
	  and setattr methods.

2000-11-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Cleaned up problems with mode in move operations, and dealt
	  with stopping when velocity is set to zero.

2000-11-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed silly typo in movement code which meant that velocity was
	  not being used to calculate direction when only velocity is
	  specified.

2000-11-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added more Python/C API code. Basic framework now exists for
	  creating and manipulating Operations in the python code.

2000-11-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added more refno capabilities

	* Fixed some operation instantiation bugs

	* Added full support for creator entity. Admin client can now populate
	  the world with items and NPCs.

2000-11-09  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Removed two conflicting "WorldRouter * world" members from
	  class hierarchy.

	* Added setting of refno to operations, so client can tell
	  what they apply to.

	* Sorted out initialisation of python path.

	* Added loading of admin account, allowing admin client to communicate.

	* Made sure all attributes of created objects are set, so that
	  character gender works.

	* Added face attribute to Thing, to indicate what direction it faces!

	* Modified error operation so it complies with traditional format

2000-11-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added enough python interface to load a simple module, get the
	  class from it, instantiate that class, and call operation methods
	  from it. Still to be implented is the Atlas-C++ API for embedded
	  python.

2000-11-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed movement code so that id of object to be moved is correctly
	  present. uclient now sees movement. Woohoo!

2000-11-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixed. uclient movement now works within the server,
	  but uclient does not like the responses it gets.

	* Fixed a bug which caused a segfault when movement stops.

2000-11-05  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixes, including lots of clearer debugging output.
	  Still does not seem to correctly handle moves which don't 
	  specify direction.

2000-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixes. I now get almost expected behavoir

	* Switched over to new Atlas location spec now that this is supported
	  by uclient.

2000-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Improved debugging output in movement code, and fixed some critical
	  bugs which meant that movement was not working correctly.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Modified legacy location code so it is now activated by a single
	  #define

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added temporary support for old Atlas style location object
	  in entity to move operations. This allows uclient to work for
	  now until it moves over to the latest Atlas spec.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed some attributes of in-game object

	* Added temporary support for old style Atlas location so we still
	  work with uclient.

	* Fixed it so that server does not exit if client negotiation fails.

	* Cleaned up detection of disconnected client

	* Re-wrote thing factory so it is now a static object instance rather
	  that a static method, and added the beginnings of support for
	  python "Thing" classes.

2000-10-31  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Modified stream code to get rid of seeking-on socket problem

2000-10-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>
