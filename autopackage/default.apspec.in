[Description]
Cyphesis is a very simple world simulator. NPCs that do things according to
rules. They have minds with simple input and output. They can
use/move/make things and have simple discussion. They can deduce
simple things (like where I can get these things and where I should
be). They have simple memory and use it too. They can have goals (like
build home for me or go to dinner).
This package includes the rules data, scripts and map data required for the
Mason game. Use this package if you intend to run an Mason server.
